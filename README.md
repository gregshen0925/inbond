# What is InBond?

With our platform, investing in ICOs has never been easier or more secure. The InBond protocol works by giving investors a convertible bond when they invest in a project instead of getting tokens upfront. This bond can be used for voting(for proposals) and can be converted to tokens at any time or even redeem their investment back. Meanwhile, developers should create proposals and wait approval before they could withdraw the funds they have raised.

Besides we can also create a convertible market (innovative in web3) to enable tradings and.generate platform income.

By adding tokenomic and well-designed mathematical models to InBond, we incentivize both investors and honorable developers to meet on our platform.

# Why Aptos?
Upgradability of Move langauge enables builders to add function step by step. In EVM, if a dev wants to add function for a coin, they develop new contracts so that users have to approve new contracts. Not only causes bad user experience but also safety issues since user could approve malicious contract from phishing sites.
